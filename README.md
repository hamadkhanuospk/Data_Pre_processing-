# Data_Pre_processing-
1. By considering the data dictionary file, do exploratory data analysis on the data (i.e.
   Histogram, Scatter plots, Boxplots, Outlier detection, missing values identification etc).
2. Find the missing values of every attribute and replace it with the appropriate central
   tendency. However, the replacement with central should be justified.
3. Find the outliers using boxplot and by employing the outliers formula (quartiles and IQR)
   and report how many percentage of data having outliers. Moreover, you need to replace
   outliers with the appropriate central tendency (may be median).
4. Do perform correlation between the attributes and identify the highly correlated attributes
   i.e. 0.6 or higher.
5. The ‘Year in current job’ need to be in replaced using the following highlighted format
